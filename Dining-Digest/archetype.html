            <p>Some description of the archetype here. For example, we might make the assumption that you must be down bad for Jo's because otherwise how is it possible for you to have swiped the most frequently at such late hours? We get it, the milkshake is to die for.</p>

            <p>You most frequently swiped between 10:00PM ~ 2:00AM. How do you even do that?</p>

            <h3>Take-Out | (xx/yyy swipes)</h3>
            <p>You more frequently swiped at take-out style dining halls (Andrews, Ivy Room, Jo's).</p>

            <h4>Trend: How your swiping frequency changes across the week</h4>
            <h3>Balanced | (score metric)</h3>
            <p>The amount you swipe each day doesn't fluctuate so much throughout the week. Consistency is key!</p>
